Notes to Machine Learning
---

These are the notes I took while reading [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/). Some of the notes also came from other sources, but the majority of them are from these two books.

The notes can be viewed [here](http://rpubs.com/runzemc/ml_notes).
